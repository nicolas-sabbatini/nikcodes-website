# Impossible list.
I’ve always been fantasizing about my future, thinking about all the things I wanted to accomplish or do.
Needless to say, I never got around to any of it (except maybe a few minor goals).
I always felt overwhelmed by the number of things I want to do/learn, till I came across a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6apcEae2U4w) from [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/) about an idea that he had from [Joel Runyon](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/), this idea is the impossible list.

This list didn't fully remove the overwhelming feeling when I  think about the future, but it gives me a path to accomplish most of my goals.

### What is a Impossible list?

[The impossible list is NOT a bucket list](https://impossiblehq.com/the-impossible-list-is-not-a-bucket-list/), the impossible list is a challenge and a journal that helps to give narration to your story.
