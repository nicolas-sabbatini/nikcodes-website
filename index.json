I’ve always been fantasizing about my future, thinking about all the things I wanted to accomplish or do. Needless to say, I never got around to any of it (except maybe a few minor goals). I always felt overwhelmed by the number of things I want to do/learn, till I came across a video from Thomas Frank about an idea that he had from Joel Runyon, this idea is the impossible list.\nThis list didn\u0026rsquo;t fully remove the overwhelming feeling when I think about the future, but it gives me a path to accomplish most of my goals.\nWhat is a Impossible list?
