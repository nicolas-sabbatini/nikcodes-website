[{"content":"Impossible list. I’ve always been fantasizing about my future, thinking about all the things I wanted to accomplish or do. Needless to say, I never got around to any of it (except maybe a few minor goals). I always felt overwhelmed by the number of things I want to do/learn, till I came across a video from Thomas Frank about an idea that he had from Joel Runyon, this idea is the impossible list. This list didn\u0026rsquo;t fully remove the overwhelming feeling that I feel when I think about the future, but it gives me a path to accomplish most of my goals.\nWhat is a Impossible list? It gives purpose to your actions and it gives context to your journey. The impossible list is NOT a bucket list, the impossible list is a challenge and a journal that helps to give narration to your story. The original impossible list of Joel Runyon\nMy impossible list Goals  Get my bachelor degree in computer science Get my master degree in computer science Participate in a game jam - Completed 2017/12/01 Entry - TODO: update link Get my driver licence Start a blog Start a youtube chanel - TODO: add day  Reach 100 subscribers    Fitness  Run a 4km marathon - Completed 2017/10/28 Time:30' Run a 4km marathon in less than 16' Run a 10km marathon Lift 50 kg in bench press Do 100 push-ups in a single set Do 20 vertical push up in a single set Get a six pack Lose 5kg - Completed 2019/04/04 Lose 10Kg Start swimming lessons: - Completed 2021/01/01  Learn to swim butterfly - Completed 2021/03/01    Skills  Learn Parkour Learn Slacklining Learn Juggling Learn to play the ukulele Learn to meditate Learn to compose music Learn to draw Learn to skateboarding  Finance  Get a job - TODO: add day  Get a job abroad   Invest in the stock market - TODO: add day Buy a car Buy a motorcycle Buy a house Buy a small flat in other country Buy crypto Open my NFT store Sell my digital art  Programing  Learn HTML - Completed 2018/07/xx Learn CSS Learn vanilla JS Make my website - TODO: add day Have my own domain - Completed 2018/10/11 Earn 100 dollars with something I had published Make a neural network that compose music  Travel  Visit 10 different countries - already:  Brasil Mexico Japan USA Canada Cuba Colombia   Travel alone Travel with friends - Completed 2019/01/09 Visit all continents Go to Brazilian Carnival in Rio de Janeiro Make a road trip between countries  Activities  Publish a book Start a band Skydive Bungee jump Climb a mountain Be on TV Be on a movie Go to space Break a world record Kitesurf Surf Scuba diving Name something Wingsuit fly Windsurf - TODO: add day  Books  Mind set Mindfulness You are not so smart Brain rules Algorithm desing Introduction to algorithms Skiena the algorithm design manual Understanding comics Reinventing Comics Making Comics Little Wars Floor Games So good they can\u0026rsquo;t ignore you Getting things done HOW TO INVENT EVERYTHING La ética hacker How Pac-Man Eats https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/ What We Owe to Each Other Death by Todd May Generative Design, Revised and Updated Edition  ","permalink":"https://nikcodes.xyz/posts/impossible_list/","summary":"Impossible list.
