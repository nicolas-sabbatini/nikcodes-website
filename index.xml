      <description>Impossible list. Iâ€™ve always been fantasizing about my future, thinking about all the things I wanted to accomplish or do. Needless to say, I never got around to any of it (except maybe a few minor goals). I always felt overwhelmed by the number of things I want to do/learn, till I came across a video from Thomas Frank about an idea that he had from Joel Runyon, this idea is the impossible list.</description>

      <title>10 Print</title>
      <link>https://nikcodes.xyz/posts/print-10/</link>

      <guid>https://nikcodes.xyz/posts/print-10/</guid>
      <description>10 Print 10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10
A implementation of the program 10 print in Rust and using the crate macroquad.
The implementation tries to be the most faithful to the original source in respect of the aspect ratio and colors, if you resize the windows the proportion is going to get lost.
Something that cannot be reproduced with the approach is being a one-liner and be readable at the same time.</description>
